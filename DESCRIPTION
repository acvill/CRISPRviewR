Description: 
    MinCED is a program to find Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
    Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) in bacterial genomes or metagenomic contigs.
    The CRISPRviewR package includes functions to compare and visualize CRISPR
    arrays across MinCED outputs, like different strain genomes or time-course
    metagenomic assemblies.
    The general workflow involves reading in MinCED data with `read_minced()`,
    merging datasets with `merge_minced()`, grouping arrays with
    `group_arrays()`, and plotting array groups with `plot_arrays()`.
